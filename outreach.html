                <p>The Titanium Titans Robotics Team keeps their calendar full throughout the off-season with a range of activities to help develop an interest in robotics and technology.</p>
            <h2>Team Sponsoring and Mentoring</h2>
                <p>Corporations understand the need to support college and high school programs, Titanium Titans understand how important it is to assist in the development of that talent, we hope, will one day join our team.

                As a result, Titanium Titan team members work hard, in the spirit of gracious professionalism, to help teams at the FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC), FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and FIRST LEGO League (FLL) level organize and grow. Efforts include organizing information meetings, providing 501c3 status, and mentoring whenever possible. In fact, Titanium Titans sponsored two thirds of the FTC teams currently competing in Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>

This scrimmage introduced the many rookie teams to the competition field and the general public to FIRST. Several colleges and technology companies provided information on STEM career paths for students and were also introduced to FIRST.</p>
            <h2>Community Events</h2>
                <p>To reach a broader audience, the Titanium Titans has set up a booth at the Peters Township Community Day.
